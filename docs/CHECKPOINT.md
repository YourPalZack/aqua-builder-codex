## Checkpoint â€” Phase 2 (M1 complete)

Implemented
- Wizard: Beginner score, equipment guidance, review & share (copy link), error boundary.
- Browse: Fish/Filters with chips + pagination; Plants/Heaters/Lights chips + pagination; Substrate and Extras tabs.
- Persistence: Build state persisted via localStorage.
- Admin: /admin/prices with add/update and price table; zod-validated API.
- API envelopes: Standardized error envelope for key endpoints.
- UI Primitives: Chip, ScoreBadge, Toast.

Build & Test
- Production builds pass (`pnpm --filter ./apps/web build`).
- QA agent is implemented; runner needs loader tweak in Node 22 (to be addressed next).

Next (M2 start)
- Fix QA runner loader and extend tests (admin price, tabs rendering, score display).
- Summary: add beginner score parity with wizard, and warnings render.
- Standardize error envelopes for remaining routes.

How to minimize token/context usage going forward
- Use this file, docs/PHASE_2_PLAN.md, docs/TODO.md, and docs/UPDATE_LOG.md as canonical context.
- When handing off or resuming, reference these docs instead of replaying chat history.
- Summarize only diffs since last checkpoint in status updates.
